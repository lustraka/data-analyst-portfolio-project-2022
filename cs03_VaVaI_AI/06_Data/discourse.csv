"The protocol is subject to change, however protocol changes must be documented, to affirm that the research work is comprehensive, clear, reproducible and is of high quality.","Okoli (2015)|Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","FixMe Update reference to Okoli"
"Restrict search within bounds of research question - Templier & Paré (2015) and Okoli (2015) agree that the research question must be the focus of the investigation and that the search strategy must be aligned to the research question(s). On the other hand, Bandara et al., (2015) argue that the research questions should be allowed to emerge as data (literature) is collected and analysed. The later argument holds where a strongly inductive approach is being followed, often within an iterative hermeneutic stance (Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2014).","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"Select and apply appropriate method - A variety of methods can be used to analyse, synthesise and interpret literature, including soft systems methodology for heterogeneous literature (Sylvester et al., 2013), grounded theory techniques for theory-building literature reviews (Wolfswinkel et al., 2013), critical discourse analysis (Wall et al., 2015), meta-analysis techniques (Templier & Paré, 2015; vom Brocke et al., 2015) and so on. Geeling et al., (2017) show that thematic analysis could be integrated with grounded theory techniques, while mixed studies combine qualitative and quantitative techniques (Bandara et al., 2015). A hermeneutic review emphasizes the importance of integrating literature searches with the analysis and interpretation of text (Boell and Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2014).","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
