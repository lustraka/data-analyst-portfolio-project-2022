# Train SLR Model
> I am going to master the craft of writing "Marketingov√© studie" for R&D proposals, mainly in AI. A crutial step of proposal drafting is providing information about the current state of the domain. An ideal input for this step is a systematic literature review (SLR). Therefore, the goal of this case study is to set up a model for conducting SLRs based on 8 selected studies. The next step will be the validation of the model using another 5 studies as a benchmark.
