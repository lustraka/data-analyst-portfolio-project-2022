# Clarify Purpose
**Purpose**. A crutial step of drafting R&d proposals is providing information about the current state of the domain. Obviously, an appropriate input for this step is a systematic literature review (SLR). Therefore, the goal of this case study is to set up a model for conducting SLRs based on some methodological sources and 8 selected review studies. The next step will be the validation of the model using another 5 studies as a benchmark.

> “An **SLR** is a review of an existing body of literature that follows a transparent and reproducible methodology in searching, assessing its quality and synthesizing it, with a high level of objectivity.” (Kraus et al., 2020)

**Double S Approach**. Beside the systematic approach to searching papers and assessing their quality, there is an opportunity to apply the methodology of requirements specification to the subject matter of the review study. Identify requirements and evaluate thier fullfilment in relevant resources. Identify the gaps and specify requirements for the next developmental stage of the given system or domain.
