## (WP-REQ) Wrangle SLR Requirements
**2022-08-31 Wed** (1) **Extract requirements**. The first step of extracting requirments is focused on `Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)`. (a) Input data into `concepts.csv` or `discourse.csv`. (2) Check and output data for further use in appropriate Jupyter notebook. There are a couple of formats - plain text, html or md. Last two (html, md) need to copy-paste output to a markdown cell. The markdown formating provides most flexible rendering - notes and maybe also sources can be listed below the main table. (2) **Next steps**. (a) I need to saturate the list of requirements to the state where there is nothing to remove without losing significant value (rather than to add more details). (b) Then I can map the content of selected AI SLRs. (c) While doing (a) and (b) I can build the execution engine of the SL-Reviewer model.

### Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)
The table x compares the SL-Reviewer's states with five major stages identified by Oosterwyk (2019) and the CADIMA protocol.
