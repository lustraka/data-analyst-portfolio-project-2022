"systematic literature review (SLR)","A review of an existing body of literature that follows a transparent and reproducible methodology in searching, assessing its quality and synthesising it, with a high level of objectivity.","Kraus, Sascha et al. (2020)|p.1026","note"
"SL-Reviewer","The system (model) for producing systematic literature reviews.","This study","note"
"SL-Reviewer's States","Ask questions (SAQ)|Collect data (SCD)|Explore data (SED)|Synthesise knowledge (SSK)|Write the review (SWR)","This study","note"
"SAQ-|Agree on detailed procedure","WHILE asking questions and WHERE there are several researchers involved, the SL-Reviewer shall agree on detailed procedure.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","To ensure shared understanding and agreement."
"SAQ-|Specify primary goal","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall specify primary goal.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","To justify the need for a standalone review. To inform selection of the structure and type of review required."
"SAQ-|Define key concepts","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall define key concept(s) of relevance.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","IF the review has a strong inductive, theory-building intent, THEN this requirment is less relevant."
"SAQ-|Establish boundaries","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall establish the scope and boundaries.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","To inform subsequent stages of search and selection."
"SAQ-|Draft the research questions","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall draft the research questions.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","To inform selection of type of literature review to be conducted.|The research question should be a one-to-two sentence statement that explains the aim and outcome (Okoli, 2015), and perhaps review’s audience (e.g., scholars, practitioners, policy makers, etc.). For inductive studies the research question may be more openended (Bandara et al., 2015)."
"SAQ-|Specify type of review","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall specify type of review.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SAQ-|Specify disposition","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall specify sequential or iterative disposition.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SAQ-|Conduct reviewer training","WHILE asking questions, the SL-Reviewer shall conduct reviewer training in note-taking and reviewing methods.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","To produce a review with a reliable standard."
"SCD-|Specify where to search","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall specify where to search.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","In standalone reviews, sources such as the AIS Electronic Library (AISeL), JSTOR, ABI/Inform, IEEE Xplore and ISI Web of Science are frequently used in IS (Bandara et al., 2015, Okoli 2015)."
"SCD-|Identify the main sources","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall identify the main peer refereed journal and conference outlets.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","Bandara et al., (2015) and Levy & Ellis (2006) recommend the use of top ranked peer-refereed journals and conference outlets. In IS, these would include the AIS “basket of eight” (MISQ, EJIS, ISJ, JMIS, ISR, JAIS, JIT, JSIS) and AIS top 4 conferences (ICIS, EICS, PACIS, AMCIS) (Schryen, 2015). Additional top IS journals can be identified through bibliometric studies such as that of Lowry et al., (2013). In addition sources such as the Clarivate Analytics journal citation report (https://jcr.incites.thomsonreuters.com) and Scimago (https://www.scimagojr.com) provide details of high impact journals in a domain of study. Conference ranking systems in IS are rare, but some exist, e.g. the Australian Computing Research and Education site (http://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal), and the IFIP TC8 rankings (http://ifiptc8.dsi.uminho.pt/index.php/events/ranking-of-is-conferences). Some studies limit the search to journals only, or even the AIS top 8 journals. Whatever the decision, it must be documented and justified."
"SCD-|Specify terms to use","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall specify terms to use (search string).","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","It is recommended to select keywords from identified papers. Taxonomies suitable for the literature review can be utilised. For example, many of the taxonomies of keywords can be found on the ACM website (http://www.acm.org/about/class/class/2012) provides taxonomies of keywords. These references are only keywords and hence, should be combined to create search strings. Keywords that are linked with logical operators are frequently used in literature databases as search strings (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) (Schryen, 2015)."
"SCD-|Specify dimensions to search","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall specify dimensions (topic, title, keywords, abstract, results etc.) to search.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SCD-|Specify timespan","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall specify timespan.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","Mapping the literature based on a specific timeframe e.g. looking at past studies going back 10 years should be sufficient (Templier & Paré, 2015; vom Brocke et al., 2015)."
"SCD-|Restrict search","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall restrict search within bounds of research question.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SCD-|Minimize publication bias","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall minimize publication bias (grey and unpublished data.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","Publication bias refers to the “problem that significant (and supporting) results are more likely to be published than non-significant (and non-supporting) results” (Templier & Paré, 2015). Topic-specific dissertations and unpublished research reports could be included as well, where the research protocol suggests inclusion of such sources."
"SCD-|Perform backward and forward search","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall perform backward and forward search.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","A backward search refers to the process of identifying articles by searching the reference lists of important papers (Webster & Watson, 2002; vom Brocke et al., 2015). The forward search refers to identifying articles that have cited some important papers. Google Scholar and Web of Science provide the function to forward search (Schryen, 2015; Webster & Watson, 2002)."
"SCD-|Specify inclusion criteria","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall specify inclusion criteria.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","Inclusion criteria refer to the criteria used to select papers, based on, for example the research question and scope of study etc. Should several researchers be working on the literature review paper, a standardized inclusion criterion needs to be discussed and agreed upon (Bandara et al., 2015)."
"SCD-|Specify exclusion criteria","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall specify exclusion criteria.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","To increase validity of any paper, it is important to state the criteria used to exclude research. This increases the credibility of the paper and ensures other authors can reference the published work confidently (Bandara et al., 2015). An example of excluding research is to not use duplicate studies in different sources or forms such as a conference papers subsequently published as journal articles (Bandara et al., 2015; Schryen 2015)."

"SCD-|Review introduction and conclusion","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall review introduction and conclusion and apply screen.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SCD-|Review full papers","WHILE collecting data, the SL-Reviewer shall review full papers for relevance, rigour and credibility.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SED-|Select and apply appropriate method","WHILE exploring data, the SL-Reviewer shall select and apply appropriate method.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","The choice of method is determined by its appropriateness to the research question, the type of literature review being conducted, and the corpus of literature."
"SSK-|Select and apply appropriate method","WHILE synthesising knowledge, the SL-Reviewer shall select and apply appropriate method.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","The choice of method is determined by its appropriateness to the research question, the type of literature review being conducted, and the corpus of literature."
"SWR-|Specify structural elements","WHILE writing the review, the SL-Reviewer shall specify structural elements, such as introduction, definitions, methodology, analysis, synthesis and interpretation, outcome, conclusion.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
"SWR-|Consider presentation","WHILE writing the review, the SL-Reviewer shall consider presentation, such are diagrams, visuals, illustrations and tables.","Oosterwyk, Grant et al (2019)","note"
