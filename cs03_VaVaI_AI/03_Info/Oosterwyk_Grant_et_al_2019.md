title|[A Synthesis of Literature Review Guidelines from Information Systems Journals](https://easychair.org/publications/open/2h3r)
abstract|There has recently been a plethora of guidelines published in Information Systems (IS) journals on how to conduct literature reviews for publication, often referred to as “systematic” literature reviews. The purpose of this paper is to make sense of these guidelines by synthesising them into a coherent whole. The synthesis results in the identification of five major stages for conducting literature reviews for publication, i.e. (1) Define the protocol, (2) Search the literature, (3) Select the papers, (4) Analyse, synthesise and interpret the data, (5) Write the review. The synthesis reveals that there are different types of literature review, but that the five broad stages are generally valid for all types. Differences in conducting literature review across type arise at a lower level of detail, when considering the specific activities to be performed at each stage. The greatest variation between types occurs at Stage 4, when analysing, synthesising and interpreting data.

abstract|This article examines the nature, role and function of the literature review in academic discourse. Researchers in information systems (IS) are often advised to espouse a neutral viewpoint and adapt the goal of synthesising previous literature when conducting a literature review. However, since research literature in many areas of IS is diverse and heterogeneous, this synthesis is not value neutral, but is a construction of the researchers. We suggest that other goals and viewpoints for reviewing and presenting previous literature are possible, and in some cases, desirable. Using the example of service quality literature, we use a lens of historical discourse, and techniques of soft systems analysis and rich pictures, to present previous research literature on ServQual-related research in IS and electronic commerce. We identify seven ‘stories’ from service quality research literature and analyse the clients, actors, transformations, world-view (weltanschauung), owners and environment in each story. We conclude that alternative presentations of research literature can offer fresh insights, especially in areas where the research literature is diffuse, contradictory and heterogeneous.
