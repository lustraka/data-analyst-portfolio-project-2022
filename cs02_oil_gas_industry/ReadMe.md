# Oil & Gas Industry Case Study
Model the value chain.

## Clarify Purpose
The purpose of this case study is to build a business knowledge blueprint for the given industry using automated web searches combined with focused reading. The general idea is to:
- build a catalogue of internet nodes (hostnames) representing industry actors (or stakeholders)
- identify triples representing a value chain (or business model) ontology
   - subject is a category of actors
   - predicate represents a relation to some concept, e.g. product 
- seek out urls with occurences of these triples, i.e. evidence

Using HTML files ensures the capability of automated curation of the body of knowledge.
