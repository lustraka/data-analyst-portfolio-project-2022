# Case Study : Critical Data Studies' Methods
ðŸš§ Status: Under construction! ðŸš§ 
## Clarify Purpose
The purpose of this study is to analyse best practices and lessons learned in the area of critical data studies (CDS). The point of departure are examples of CDSs featuring various methods in Kitchin (2021b). As these examples cover time up to December 2020, the goal of this project is to compile an annual report summarizing studies published in 2021 and their employed methods.

The AREA Method (Einhorn 2017) helps me bring greater **CARE** to making smarter, better decisions:
- Craft critical concepts
- Address biases
- Reveal perspectives
- Extract learning

## Collect Elements
- [Journal](cs01_journal.md) tracks the research journey of this case study including effort
- Knowledge Base holds the Term-Association ontology (TAO) inluding instances
  - `tao_iim.py`: a module for loading, adding and dumping data to the knowledge base
  - `elem.txt`, `rels.csv`, `relt.csv`: the knowledge base (editable)
  - `batches_RRRRMMDD.txt`: a set of triples added to the baseline
- Notebooks IPYNB document the workflow
  - 20211130_Build_knowledge_base: used for populating a knowledge base with references from Kitchin (2021b)
- Deliverables indicate the progress

## Compose Relationships
The initial concept model of TAO-IIM for this case study includes four concepts:

## Conduct Pre-Mortem
**2021-11-30**: I need a clear structure for this study, otherwise I **get lost**. After a couple of first fsp spent on the study I can set a time limit. This is a part of my one-sided contract for this artwork.
**2021-12-01**: Originally I wanted to write my own CDS in the domain of EU grants but I became aware of the **lack of expertise** and so also a problematic feasibility of such endeavour. Even if the Kitchin's survey of methods is quite fresh, I can try to set up a analytics system for monitoring new CDS to identify methods they employed. The goal could be identifying the best practices and lessons learned. It is good to maintain an observer status ðŸ˜‡.
