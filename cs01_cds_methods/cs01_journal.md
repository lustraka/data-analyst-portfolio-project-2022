# Case Study CS01 Journal

This journal provides the oveview of case study's activities (transactions) for future reference. Steps taken are accompanied with effort records (in squared brackets) measured in fibonacci story points (fsp).

## Design Next Steps
The *map citations in Kitchen (2021b)* process includes steps:
- process **cites**  triples and **instantiates** triples for CDS methods
- dump the knowledge base for manual embelishment
- add titles of references
- find out full text documents and choose at least 3 examples of each CDS method.

## Journal Recent Activities
**2021-11-30 Tue**:
- (1) **Boot-Root**. The *set-up a node for case study* process includes steps:
  - create a `cs01_scd_methods` subfolder in the `data-analyst-portfolio-2022` repository,
  - create a `Readme.md` root document structured properly to focus attention,
  - create a `data` subfolder in the `data-analyst-portfolio-2022` repository and upload the baseline files of the knowledge base,
  - create the first IPYNB notebook to populate the knowledge base and test loading, updating, and dumping the knowledge base,
  - create a jounal, document the effort so far, and plan the next step [6 fsp].

## Backlog and ToDos
- [ ] Document the knowledge base with Term-Association Ontology Internal Information Management (TAO-IIM)
