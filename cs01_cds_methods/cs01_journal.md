# Case Study 01 Journal

This journal provides the overview of case study's activities (transactions) for future reference. Records of steps taken are accompanied with effort entries (in square brackets) measured in fibonacci story points (fsp). A part of the reflection process is moving recent journal entries into the archive section.

## Design Document Transformations
The *map CDS methods based on Kitchen (2021b)* process includes steps:
- *map references to the CDS methods based on Kitchin (2021b)* process (See Journal 2021-11-30/2)
- find out full text documents, choose at least 3 examples of each CDS method,
- add the **"embodies"** type triples and elements with the `title` and `url` attributes by hand,
- check the integrity of the knowledge base.

Candidates for next steps are:
- [ ] Change "a CDS *uses* a method" relation type to "a CSD *employs* a method" type Consider same change for *instantiates*.

## Journal Recent Activities
**2021-11-30 Tue**:
- (1) **Boot-Root**. The *set-up a node for case study* process includes steps:
  - create a `cs01_scd_methods` subfolder in the `data-analyst-portfolio-2022` repository,
  - create a `Readme.md` root document structured properly to focus attention,
  - create a `data` subfolder in the `data-analyst-portfolio-2022` repository and upload the baseline files of the knowledge base,
  - create the first IPYNB notebook to populate the knowledge base and test loading, updating, and dumping the knowledge base,
  - create a jounal, document the effort so far, and plan the next step [6 fsp].
- (2) **CDS References**. The *map references to the CDS methods based on Kitchen (2021b)* process includes steps:
  - process the **"cites"** type  triples and the **"instantiates"** type triples for CDS methods in Kitchen (2021b)
  - dump the knowledge base for manual embelishment
  - add titles of references [8 fsp]
- (3) **Modus Operandi**. While embelishing data by hand I can use a local clone of the GitHub repository, then pull changes to origin and download files again in Colab.


## Curate Backlog and ToDos
- [ ] Document the knowledge base with Term-Association Ontology Internal Information Management (TAO-IIM)
- [ ] Clarify the nature of CDS methods and check their employment in selected documents
